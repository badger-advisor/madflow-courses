Topics reviewed include reading/writing data and objects from/to files and exception handling, and command line arguments. Topics introduced: object-oriented design; class vs. object; create and define interfaces and iterators; searching and sorting; abstract data types (List,Stack,Queue,PriorityQueue(Heap),Binary Search Tree); generic interfaces (parametric polymorphism); how to design and write test methods and classes; array based vs. linked node implementations; introduction to complexity analysis; recursion.

Students are required to design and implement using high quality professional code, a medium sized program, that demonstrates knowledge and use of latest language features, tools, and conventions. Additional topics introduced will include as needed for projects: inheritance and polymorphism; anonymous inner classes, lambda functions, performance analysis to discover and optimize critical code blocks. Students learn about industry standards for code development. Students will design and implement a medium size project with a more advanced user-interface design, such as a web or mobile application with a GUI and event- driven implementation; use of version-control software.

Both classical (e.g., nearest neighbor, filtering) and modern deep learning based (e.g., ConvNets, GANs) algorithms will be presented for image representation, synthesis, and manipulation.  It will be a mix of instructor led lectures and student led presentations.  Students will learn to implement their own algorithms for image synthesis and manipulation, to understand and analyze state-of-the-art techniques, and to identify interesting open questions and future directions.  It should be of relevance to students interested in computer vision, machine learning, and graphics.\n\nPrerequisites:\nIt is recommended that students have taken either an intro computer vision or machine learning course.  Students are also strongly recommended to have basic knowledge of probability and linear algebra, and Python programming experience.",

In the past decade, reinforcement learning algorithms have demonstrated impressive empirical successes ranging from beating a human world champion at the board game Go to allowing robots to learn difficult manipulation skills. This course aims to introduce students to reinforcement learning and topics at the forefront of reinforcement learning research. The first half of the course provides an introduction to RL fundamentals and then covers advanced topics in the reinforcement learning research literature such as hierarchical and deep reinforcement learning. The course will assume familiarity with probability, statistics, and topics covered in an introductory machine learning class. Familiarity with the Python programming language is recommended.\n\nCounts as AI breadth course.",
